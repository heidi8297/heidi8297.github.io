          <p>pane ONE: This is the story of nearly 9000 natural disasters that have occurred
            globally between 1960 and 2018.  If it feels like more disasters have
            occurred in recent years, your perception is correct.  The increasing
            frequency is troubling (particularly when broken down by type) as is
            the nature and impact of those events, and who is most affected by them.
            Let's take a look...</p>

          <p>pane TWO: This data set chronicles disasters across 7 different categories shown

            <p>pane THREE B: If we compare the first 10 years of the data set with the last 10
              years, the trend is clear: disasters are occurring now more than ever.
              How long can we realistically sustain (survive) this?</p>

          <div class='trigger pane4' data-step='4'>
            <p>pane FOUR: So what is the impact?  Where are we seeing the largest loss of life?
              If we look at total death counts by event type, we can see that so
              far the largest death tolls have been from earthquakes and storms.</p>

            <p>pane SIX: If we look now at the death toll for each individual event and how
              those tolls are distributed for each type, we can see which types of
              events are most likely to cause loss of life.  The highest typical
              death toll is for "extreme temperature", which is particularly troubling
              when combined with the trends from the previous pane. </p>

            While no single event can definitively be attributed to climate change,
            the evidence is abundantly clear that the trend is certainly causally
            related, and it's indisputable at this point that our actions are causing
            climate change to occur in the first place.<br><br>
            It's not too late to start taking your carbon footprint seriously.<br /> <br />
            Fly less. &nbsp&nbsp Buy electric. &nbsp&nbsp Eat less meat.<br /><br />
            Don't dismiss the power of small actions over time, don't dismiss the
            influence that your actions will have on those around you, and - most of all - don't dismiss hope.
            <br /><br />The next generation is counting on us.
